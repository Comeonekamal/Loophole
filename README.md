# **Purpose**:
#### This script is meant to streamline the use of Onedrive in Coolhole allowing users to avoid Google Drive for custom content.
<br/>


# **Prerequisite**:
#### 1) Make a [*Onedrive*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage) account (its free, just need an email).
#### 2) Upload a video to Onedrive.
#### 3) Download latest Python and install (https://www.python.org/downloads/, the version needs to be atleast 3.10.9 or higher)*
  **IMPORTANT: While installing manually make sure to tick the `Add to Path` box when asked.**
  
  > **The batch file will install (Python 3.10.9) if you don't want to do it yourself, if you already have python the script **skips** this step*.
#### 4) Download the repo or the release to a folder and extract it (click on the green "Code" button -> Download ZIP)
<br/>

<br/> 
 
# **How to use**:
#### 1) In the extraction location, double click the "run.bat" file.It should prompt you with:
      "Enter your Onedrive Share-Link: ".   
#### 2) Paste the "Share-Link" from onedrive and hit enter. To get "Share-Link": click on your video in onedrive, at the top should be a "Copy Link" button.
#### 3) The program should output the "permanant link" to add to coolhole. It shouldn't take more than 10 seconds.
